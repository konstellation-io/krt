# krt

KRT management library

AI Orchestrator products are what we call AI projects within the AI Orchestrator.

These AIO products are defined using YAML files referred to as KRTs (Konstellation Runtime Transport). 

A KRT delineates a specific version of a product by outlining the distinct workflows and processes, along with the versions assigned to each process within them.

This library is in charge of validating and parsing KRT files.
